	"mainbox.text": "<b>BON in a Box</b> (Biodiversity Observation Network in a Box) is a customizable and continually updated toolkit. It provides access to the latest biodiversity observation design, data collection protocols, and dat management, analysis and reporting tools.  It serves as a technology transfer and capacity building mechanism to ensure you have access to the best and most up-to-date tools and technologies for building a biodiversity observation system.</br> BON in a Box connects tools users and developers to promote ongoing tool improvements and the development of new tools.  The goal is to <b>lower the threshold for the start-up or enhancement of a biodiversity observation networks</b> and support more effective conservation actions through the improved supply of quality biodiversity data.  BON in a Box is a Group on Earth Observations – Biodiversity Observation Network initiative and the development of this Latin American regional version was led by Colombia’s Alexander von Humboldt Institute.",

	"publicbox.text": "BON in a Box is designed to serve the needs and interests of national governments who need <b>high quality biodiversity data</b> to inform their domestic and international reporting requirements and conservation commitments.  However, BON in a Box will also be useful for any organization, community or individual who is interested in starting, enhancing or harmonizing their biodiversity observation efforts.",

	"whybox.sub": "Adequate Information about Biodiversity Changes and Threats",
	"whybox.text": "Across the planet, biodiversity data is limited and poorly integrated due to varying methodologies and standards, and most existing observation systems lack capacity and are not well connected to policy needs. This limits our ability to make informed and timely conservation decisions and support sustainable development. Continual advances in biodiversity observation technologies (e.g. camera-traps, etc.), methodologies, and models are being realized, making observation efforts more powerful and efficient. However, <b>no system exists to facilitate their rapid discovery and sharing.</b></br>The Group on Earth Observations–Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON; www.geobon.org) is developing BON in a Box as a practical means by which the most effective and advanced tools can be deployed around the world to support the development of enhanced biodiversity observation Networks, increase the quantity and quality of biodiversity observations, and <b>better connect</b> them to policy-making",

The description of each label can be found in the second section, search filters. <br> When selecting a tool and follow the see more (+) link at the bottom right corner, you can access more detailed information about the tool, description, contact the developers or managers, and a specific forum for that tool where any authenticated user on the system can participate, ask questions and discuss openly about the tool. For more general questions you can use the general forum in the last section. <br> Finally you can suggest tools to be in Bon in a Box, which will be reviewed by a GeoBon experts panel and will contact the user to publish the tool with all claims.",
